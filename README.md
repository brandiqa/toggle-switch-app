# TOGGLE SWITCH APP

This is a quick demo React app for testing a Toggle Switch App component built by [Praveen Kumar](https://github.com/praveenscience). You can find the tutorial of this project on [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-toggle-switch-reusable-component/).

## Prerequisites

- LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) for Windows' users
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) optional, but recommended for faster package installs

## How to run

First ensure you have no program running at port 3000. Next, execute the following commands:

```bash
# Download app source code
git clone git@github.com:brandiqa/toggle-switch-app.git
cd toggle-switch-app

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Launch the dev server
yarn start
```

Your default browser will be launched automatically pointing to `localhost:3000`.
